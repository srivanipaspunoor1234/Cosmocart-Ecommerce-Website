# CosmoCart-Ecommerce-Website

A modern and responsive E-Commerce Web Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This app allows users to register, log in, browse products, view details, add items to a cart, and manage their orders — all wrapped in a clean and interactive UI.

# Features

~ User registration and login system
~ Browse products fetched from Fake Store API
~ Search products by name
~ View detailed information of a single product
~ Add and remove items in the cart
~ User-specific cart saved in localStorage
~ Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
~ Modern UI with gradients, hover effects, and clean layouts

# Technologies Used

~ HTML – Structure of the web pages
~ CSS – Styling, layout, and responsive design
~ JavaScript – DOM manipulation, Fetch API, localStorage, event handling

# How It Works

~ User registers an account or logs in
~ Products are displayed on the home page in a grid layout
~ Users can search for products in real-time
~ Clicking a product opens the single product view
~ Users can add products to their cart
~ The cart page allows removing items and viewing totals
~ Logout option to end session
